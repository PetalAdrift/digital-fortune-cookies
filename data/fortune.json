She once said in French, \"Si vous êtes pressé, vous devez courir,\" which means \"If you are in a hurry, then you must run.\" The moral of the fable is to keep your timetable conflicts to a minimum.",

            "text": "Back in the summer of 2023, a friend of mine and I were talking about NGOs when I asked her if she had ever heard of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Now, she didn't speak a word of French, and I had horrible pronunciation. So, naturally, she said \"no.\" I then asked her if she knew MSF or Doctors Without Borders.\n\"Everyone knows them. It's the dream of medical students.\"\nI knew that joining MSF wasn't 'worth it' financially, and to this day I wonder how much the humanitarian light is worth to people. The moral of the fable is that if you can, donate to MSF.",

It was quite clear that the intended audience were university students who had just started living by themselves with a great deal of newfound freedom. We eventually spent half an hour taking down all those ads. The moral of the fable is: stay away from drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. No amount of that **** is safe for you.",
